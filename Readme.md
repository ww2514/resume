# Research Interests

I am a student in environmental sciences with broad interests in water resource systems analysis, climate and ecosystem dynamics, and sustainability in developing countries. Challenging questions at the intersection of these fields often motivates me. I have conducted research in the Virginia Experimental Farms, in the Gulf of California, and off of Guangxi, China to study water resources and management. I am also interested in exploring international attitudes towards climate change issues.
